Angular graph project is a simple demo of usage of Chart.js in Angular js to generate a dynamic chart based on the user input.

The text area takes multiple coordinates and a plots a graph accordingly on click of 'Generate Graph' button.
User can also edit the graph by changing the coordinates in the text area and hitting the 'Generate Grapgh' button again.

Optional:
One could also use the "ng-blur" event on the text area. So that as soon as you press 'tab' ( text area losses focus) the graph is generated.
